# HackTheBoo 2022 CTF Challenges

I have written a simple solutions writeup of the solved HackTheBoo CTF challenges on my GitBook: [HackTheBoo Solved Challenges by PakCyberbot](https://pakcyberbot.gitbook.io/ctf-competitions/hacktheboo-2022/)

*Note*: There were 5 challenges for each category (Reversing, Web, Pwn, Crypto, Forensics). I was able to solve only a few of them due to a lack of time and knowledge.

Here I have uploaded the ChallengeFiles/TestFiles in order to practice what I wrote on my GitBook.

All the challenge files are straightforward forward which can give you the real flag of the CTF challenge except web_evaluation_deck and rev_cult_meeting. These two challenges TestFiles are given to find the way to hack it, after that it applied to the real challenge which was on their remote machine. 

In order to practice with web challenges. You should first have docker installed in your OS and then execute **build-docker.sh** file with Sudo permissions in order to start the web app on your local port **1337**.

```sudo ./build-docker.sh```
